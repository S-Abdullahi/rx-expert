              Terri has 30 years of experience as a hospital pharmacist. She has
              worked both in community hospital and teaching hospital settings
              as well as nursing home facilities. During that time, she gained
              experience in several clinical areas, and over the last 12 years,
              she has specialized in ensuring medication safety, managing
              pharmacy operations, and controlled substance diversion
              monitoring. She takes a very practical approach and believes all
              change must have a point and result in sustained improvement.

            In addition to understanding the ins and outs of the [controlled
            substance use] process completely, she is very proactive in coming
            to me with provider issues that she detects. She truly balances the
            administrative duties and the regulatory components demand with a
            keen sense of what my practitioners do and what their needs are on
            the ground. Terri is instrumental in working with my department,
            balancing patient care, cooperation, ability, and integrity to get
            the job done.
